            <p>I recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Political Science. I love thinking about the ways that technology affects society, from culture and communication to governing and governance to the structures that it both perpetuates and challenges. In today’s world, technology has so much power, and with that power comes the potential for good but also the potential for serious consequences. I want to spend my time thinking through these outcomes, challenging the notion that innovation for innovation’s sake is inherently good, and finding ways to use and create tech that benefit others and prioritize human rights. 
            
            <br><br>

           On a more personality-centric note, I firmly believe in the power of humanity and like to think that I approach life with a focused curiosity. I love working in teams and getting the opportunity to discuss, learn, and bounce ideas off of each other. I place a high value on perspective, both in terms of trying to see from different perspectives and others challenging my own perspective. Because of this, I want the driving motivation behind my work to be people--helping people, interacting with people, and understanding people. In my free time, I love watching sports (especially women’s soccer and gymnastics!), trying new restaurants and coffee shops, journaling, going to shows, and going on random long walks and seeing what I discover.

            <br><br>
            Currently, I am seeking full-time roles that allow me to do the above, such as working in technology policy or at tech company that prioritizes social good. Feel free to <a href="files/ReilingResume.pdf" target="_blank">download my resume </a> and/or <a class="smoothscroll" href="#resume">scroll down</a> to view a more in-depth version.

		<b>Course Highlights</b>: 
			  <br>
			  As my political science capstone course, I had the opportunity to be a part of the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program. Every week, 16 University of Pittsburgh students drove two hours to State Correctional Institution Somerset, where we met with 16 incarcerated students and learned side-by-side about mass incarceration. This course is by far my favorite and most influential course I have ever taken. While we had readings and assignments, most learning came from conversations with my incarcerated classmates, hearing and discussing first hand how the criminal justice system impacts their lives as well as their families and communities. 
			  <br>
			  Throughout the course, I extensively researched the experience of incarcerated laborers within prison and the prison-industrial complex as a whole, writing my political science capstone paper on the current state of prison labor in the United States. You can read my capstone paper <a href="files/CapstonePaper.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #9E788F">here</a>. Being a part of this course also led to my involvement in Pittsburgh's District Attorney race as well as an increased passion for changing the criminal justice system in the United States.
			  <br><br>
			  Another of my favorite courses that I took was The Future of Cities, a course offered through the Computer Science department that looked at the implications of the ways in which technology is used in urban environments. Through this course not only did I get to learn a lot about the consequences of how we are currently using technology within cities, but I also got to do in-depth research on the use and misuse of predictive policing technology and facial recognition technology. I was able to translate this in-class research into action by writing a policy memo regarding facial recognition technology as part of my internship with Pittsburgh's City Council.

                  This past semester, I interned 9 hours per week at the Office of City Councilmember Corey O'Connor through Pitt's Institute of Politics Internship & Seminar program. Through this internship, I engaged with constituents to address any concerns and answer questions that they had. Additionally, I wrote policy memos to provide a greater understanding of legislation and issues being discussed. I also attended hearings and meetings to gain a better understanding of the role and powers of local government.

                  <p>
                  This summer, I was a Congressional Affairs Intern at the Internet Education Foundation. Through this role, I primarily worked with the Congressional App Challenge (CAC), a nation-wide challenge hosted by the House of Representatives to promote computer science education. I created an Alumni Advisory Board and Challenge Ambassadors Program to help leverage the over 10,000 alumni that the CAC has. I helped see the project through from start to finish, including the initial conception of the idea, program development, applications, selection, the creation of toolkits for alumni, and next steps to ensure the longevity of the program. We held a thorough application and interview process to select a board of seven college-aged alumni and 40 high-school- and middle-school-aged Challenge Ambassadors. You can view more about the alumni program <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/get-involved/alumni/" target="_blank" style="color: #9E788F">here</a>. Additionally, I did policy research on the effects of Artificial Intelligence setting wages for workers. I also worked to build relationships with partner organizations and Congressional offices to help promote the CAC.

                  The summer after my sophomore year, I was a Forward Deployed Software Engineer Intern at Palantir Technologies. Through this role, I worked on a mobile deployment with a federal law enforcement agency. More specifically, I worked with React Native and Java to implement new features in a mobile application. I also had the opportunity to go on site and meet directly with our client. At these meetings, I discussed technical specifications of the product and provided demos of the feature I was developing. Additionally, another intern and I placed in the top three of our office's hack week. We developed a Chrome Extension called Level, which anonymizes candidate data with the goal of minimizing unconscious bias during the recruiting process.

                  The summer after my freshman year, I was one of only 24 students selected nationwide to participate in Carnegie Mellon University’s (CMU) Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE), funded by the National Science Foundation. Through my role as an Undergraduate Researcher within the Institute for Software Research, I worked on a research project entitled "Comparing Development Practices in <i>npm</i> Subcommunities." The goal of this project is to understand how practices propagate throughout open source software ecosystems, particularly Node Package Manager (<i>npm</i>). I wrote programs using Python to automatically mine software repositories and extract data from JSON files. Additionally, I used community detection techniques to identify subcommunities in <i>npm</i> and visualized these communities using the network analysis and visualization software Gephi. At the end of REUSE, I created and presented a poster to faculty and researchers from the CMU School of Computer Science, communicating in a professional manner and responding to challenging questions about my research. I also served as the Co-Social Coordinator for the REUSE program, where I organized weekly social events to engage fellow participants in the program, helped to acclimate them to Pittsburgh, and created group cohesiveness. I continued my research over the following semester.

                  Incline Consulting Group provides pro-bono consulting to nonprofits in the Pittsburgh area. As President, I was responsible for planning and executing the operations of the organization with over 60 members and 10 nonprofit clients per semester. I also led our student executive board to secure nonprofit clients, recruit new members, train new members and project managers, and host final presentations. I previously worked to create a board of alumni to provide resources and mentorship to our student consultants, developed standard operating procedures for the organization, and coordinated our rebranding from Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations to Incline Consulting Group.

Previously, as Project Manager, I led a team of five peers to provide strategic consulting to the Children's Sickle Cell Foundation (CSCF Kids). Working directly with the client, we performed a needs-based assessment to narrow the scope of our semester-long project. Throughout the course of the semester, we improved CSCF Kids' website and social media pages as well as developed a social media strategy. I also served as a consultant for Focus on Renewal, where I worked in a team to redesign their website and develop a volunteer ambassadors program.
