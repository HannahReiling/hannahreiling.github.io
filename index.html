            <h2 class="mobile">ABOUT ME</h2>

            <p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh double majoring in Computer Science and Political Science with a minor in Applied Statistics.  Though I came into both majors separately, I have been discovering more and more about the overlap between tech and politics and am interested in finding opportunities to let me explore this exciting area.  I am passionate about promoting social good in all that I do and finding ways to use technology to do so. In particular, I am interested in how technology can be used to better society, especially in relation to government and urban environments.  I am still not entirely sure what I want to do in the future, but my number one priority is that in whatever I do, I want to continue to be within a technical space, driven by social consciousness.
            
            <br>

            On a more personality-centric note, I am an eternal optimist and idealist who is constantly smiling.  I firmly believe in the power of humanity and like to think that I approach life with a focused curiousity (AKA I have an intense over-interest in everything).  I love working in teams and getting the opportunity to discuss, learn, and bounce ideas off of each other, and I place a high value on perspective, both in terms of trying to see from different perspectives and others challenging my own perspective.  Because of this, I want the driving motivation behind my work to be pepoleâ€”helping people, interacting with people, and understanding people.  When working on projects, I am very goal-oriented, always paying attention to the big picture even while determining how to best fit all of the small puzzle pieces together.

            <br>
            Currently, I am seeking opportunities, particularly summer internships, that would give me the chance to broadly explore and improve upon my technical skills within a professional setting. Feel free to <a href="files/ReilingResume.pdf" target="_blank">download my resume </a> and/or <a class="smoothscroll" href="#resume">scroll down</a> to view a more in-depth version.

                  <p>
                  Through my role as an Undergraduate Researcher at the Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University, I am working on a research project entitled "Comparing Development Practices in <i>npm</i> Subcommunities." The goal of this project is to understand how practices propagate throughout open source software ecosystems, particularly Node Package Manager (<i>npm</i>). I was given the chance to carry out this research by being one of 24 students selected nationwide to participate in Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE) funded by the National Science Foundation. <br>As a part of my research, I wrote programs using Python to automatically mine software repositories and extract data from JSON files. Additionally, I used community detection techniques to identify subcommunities in <i>npm</i> and visualized these communities using the network analysis and visualization software Gephi. At the end of REUSE, I created and presented a poster to faculty and researchers from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, communicating in a professional manner and responding to challenging questions about my research. I also served as the Co-Social Coordinator for the REUSE program, where I organized weekly social events to engage fellow participants in the program, acclimate them to Pittsburgh, and create group cohesiveness. I am continuing my research that I started over the summer during the academic year.

                  As a Project Manager for Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations, I lead a team of five peers to provide strategic and technology consulting to a specific nonprofit organization. Through this role, I serve as the main point of contact between our consulting team and the nonprofit, write a formal project proposal, determine the scope and timeline for the project, and organize team and client meetings. This semester, my team is working with the Children's Sickle Cell Foundation (CSCF Kids), an organization that provides resources and support to children with sickle cell disease and their families. Specifically, we are developing the Living Well with Sickle Cell App for iOS and Android so that it is available to their target audience of children, teens, and young adults. <br>
                  Last semester, as a consultant, I worked with Focus on Renewal, a nonprofit that provides a range of services to the Sto-Rox neighborhood of Pittsburgh. We helped the organization redesign their website and social media platforms to increase engagement with the community, particularly in terms of donations and volunteers. We also worked to establish guidelines for a volunteer ambassadors program in order to increase the number of student volunteers. At the end of the project, we created and presented a formal presentation to some of Pittsburgh's nonprofit leaders.

                  <p>
                  As a peer mentor, during orientation I provide support and activities to a group of freshmen in the honors college to help them acclimate to the university and become familiar with the resources the University Honors College (UHC) has to offer. Throughout the semester, I follow-up with my mentees on a regular basis to ensure that they are adjusting to college. As a UHC Ambassador, I serve as a liaison between the UHC and prospective students to understand the UHC and its role and hopefully encourage them to attend Pitt. Additionally, through this role I speak with current students at Pitt to promote awareness of the UHC.
