            <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, and this upcoming spring semester I will be doing an exchange program at the National University of Singapore. I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Political Science. Though I came into both majors separately, I have been discovering more and more about the overlap between tech and politics and am interested in finding opportunities to let me explore this exciting area. I am passionate about finding ways to challenge and improve the technology industry, from increasing diversity and representation in tech to ensuring that the technologies being built are positively influencing society. My current career goal is to find ways to work either in or adjacent to the technology industry while being driven by social consciousness. I am particularly interested in technology policy, diversity and inclusion work within tech, and product management.
            
            <br><br>

           On a more personality-centric note, I am an eternal optimist and idealist. I firmly believe in the power of humanity and like to think that I approach life with a focused curiosity. I love working in teams and getting the opportunity to discuss, learn, and bounce ideas off of each other. I place a high value on perspective, both in terms of trying to see from different perspectives and others challenging my own perspective. Because of this, I want the driving motivation behind my work to be peopleâ€”helping people, interacting with people, and understanding people. When working on projects, I am very goal-oriented, always paying attention to the big picture even while determining how to best fit all of the small puzzle pieces together.

            <br><br>
            Currently, I am seeking opportunities, particularly summer internships, that would give me the chance to broadly explore the intersection between technology and social good. Feel free to <a href="files/ReilingResume.pdf" target="_blank">download my resume </a> and/or <a class="smoothscroll" href="#resume">scroll down</a> to view a more in-depth version. I would also love for you to <a href="mailto:hereiling@gmail.com">contact me</a> with any questions or opportunities that you may have!

                  This summer, I was a Forward Deployed Software Engineer Intern at Palantir Technologies. Through this role, I worked on a mobile deployment with a federal law enforcement agency. More specifically, I worked with React Native and Java to implement new features in a mobile application. I also had the opportunity to go on site and meet directly with our client. At these meetings, I discussed technical specifications of the product and provided demos of the feature I was developing. Additionally, another intern and I placed in the top three of our office's hack week. We developed a Chrome Extension called Level, which anonymizes candidate data with the goal of minimizing unconscious bias during the recruiting process.

                  <p>
                  The summer after my freshman year, I was one of only 24 students selected nationwide to participate in Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s (CMU) Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE), funded by the National Science Foundation. Through my role as an Undergraduate Researcher within the Institute for Software Research, I worked on a research project entitled "Comparing Development Practices in <i>npm</i> Subcommunities." The goal of this project is to understand how practices propagate throughout open source software ecosystems, particularly Node Package Manager (<i>npm</i>). I wrote programs using Python to automatically mine software repositories and extract data from JSON files. Additionally, I used community detection techniques to identify subcommunities in <i>npm</i> and visualized these communities using the network analysis and visualization software Gephi. At the end of REUSE, I created and presented a poster to faculty and researchers from the CMU School of Computer Science, communicating in a professional manner and responding to challenging questions about my research. I also served as the Co-Social Coordinator for the REUSE program, where I organized weekly social events to engage fellow participants in the program, helped to acclimate them to Pittsburgh, and created group cohesiveness. I continued my research over the following semester.

                  <p>
                  Incline Consulting Group provides pro-bono consulting to nonprofits in the Pittsburgh area. As the Board Coordinator, I am creating a board of university officials, nonprofit contacts, and professionals to provide resources and mentorship to the student consultants. Additionally, I am currently the Project Manager for our internal project. Through this role, I am working with a team to develop standard operating procedures for the organization and coordinate and manage our rebranding from Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations to Incline Consulting Group. Further, every semester, I work with our student executive board to secure 10 nonprofit clients, train new members, and train project managers. 
                  
			<br>
Previously, in Fall 2017 as a Project Manager, I led a team of five peers to provide strategic consulting to the Children's Sickle Cell Foundation (CSCF Kids). Working directly with the client, we performed a needs-based assessment to narrow the scope of our semester-long project. Throughout the course of the semester, we improved CSCF Kids' website and social media pages as well as developed a social media strategy. In Spring 2017, I served as a consultant for Focus on Renewal, where I worked in a team to redesign their website and develop a volunteer ambassadors program.

This past year, we taught web development, and our students were able to make a website highlighting ethical clothing brands as alternatives to companies that have poor labor practices.

                  As a peer mentor, during orientation I provide support and activities to a group of freshmen in the honors college to help them acclimate to the university and become familiar with the resources the UHC has to offer.

As a UHC Ambassador, I serve as a liaison between the UHC and prospective students to understand the UHC and its role and to encourage them to choose Pitt. Additionally, through this role I speak with current students at Pitt to promote awareness of the UHC.
